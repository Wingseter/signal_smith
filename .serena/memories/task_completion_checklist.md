When finishing tasks in this repo, prefer:\n1) Run frontend lint/type-check if frontend touched.\n2) Run backend tests if pytest is available; otherwise run at least compileall syntax check.\n3) Validate Celery/route changes for sync-async boundaries and DB field consistency.\n4) For trading-critical changes, verify signal lifecycle: create -> pending/queued -> approve/execute -> DB status sync.\n5) Keep .env/.env.example and config.py contract aligned to avoid deployment drift.
