Project conventions observed:\n- Python backend uses type hints widely and async-first service APIs; Celery task layer bridges sync/async via helper.\n- Domain split by app/api/routes, app/services, app/models, app/core.\n- Logging style uses module logger with Korean/English mixed operational messages.\n- Frontend uses React+TS with domain API clients and Zustand stores; API base/ws URLs centralized in frontend/src/config.ts.\n- Existing test suite is mostly smoke/import validation plus selected unit tests (security/rate-limit/websocket manager), with limited integration coverage for trading orchestration.
